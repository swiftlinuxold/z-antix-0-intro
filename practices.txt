Each major function has its own repository.
The script main.sh in the repositories is used to transform antiX Linux into Swift Linux and is written to work independently or as part of other scripts.  Note that all variables are local.

Entering the command "exit $?" shows the exit code.

The command "exit 0" is used at the end of each script.  This signifies successful completion.

All GNU Bash scripts begin with:
#!/bin/bash
# Proper header for a Bash script.

# Check for root user login
if [ ! $( id -u ) -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "You must be root to run this script."
	echo "Please enter su before running this script again."
	exit 2
fi

Any GNU Bash script that is used in the remastering process needs to check to see if chroot mode is in place:
IS_CHROOT=0 # changed to 1 if and only if in chroot mode
USERNAME=""
DIR_DEVELOP=""

# The remastering process uses chroot mode.
# Check to see if this script is operating in chroot mode.
# /srv directory only exists in chroot mode
if [ -d "/srv" ]; then
	IS_CHROOT=1 # in chroot mode
	DIR_DEVELOP=/usr/local/bin/develop 
else
	USERNAME=$(logname) # not in chroot mode
	DIR_DEVELOP=/home/$USERNAME/develop 
fi
