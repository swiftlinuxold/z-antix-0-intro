SUMMARY
1.  Install antiX Linux in VirtualBox.  You need the guest OS for working on Swift Linux.  
Unless otherwise noted, ALL procedures described in this file are to be done in the guest OS.
2.  Fill the package directory.
3.  Install Git.
4.  Set up guest additions to allow you to share files between the host and guest OS.
5.  Create space for this project.
6.  Download this project.
7.  Copy your revised project from the guest OS to the host OS.

INSTALLING ANTIX LINUX
1.  Install antiX Linux as the guest OS in VirtualBox.
2.  When you are finished, shut down the guest OS and take a snapshot.

FILL THE PACKAGE DIRECTORY
1.  Initially, the package directory is empty except for installed packages.  
As root, enter "apt-get update" to update the package directory.
2.  After the package directory has been filled, shut down the guest OS and take a snapshot.

INSTALL AND SET UP GIT
1.  Follow the instructions at http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/ .

SET UP GUEST ADDITIONS (allows you to share files between the host and guest OS)
1.  In your host OS as the user (NOT root), enter "mkdir ~/guest".
2.  From the Guest OS, go to Devices -> Shared Folders and select the /home/(host username)/guest 
directory on your host OS.  Select "Make Permanent" option but NOT the auto-mount option.
3.  Go to Devices -> Guest Additions.
4.  As root in the Guest OS, enter the following commands:
mkdir /mnt/host
mount /media/cdrom
cd /media/cdrom
sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
5.  After the guest additions have been added, enter as root in the guest OS 
"mount -t vboxsf guest /mnt/host".  
6.  Now the /mnt/host directory in the guest OS is mirrored by the /home/(host OS username)/share 
directory in the host OS.
7.  PLEASE NOTE: The file sharing capability is NOT automatic.  Each time you boot up the guest 
OS, you'll have to become root in the guest OS and enter "mount -t vboxsf guest /mnt/host" in 
order to resume sharing files between the guest and host OS.
8.  Power down VirtualBox and take a snapshot.

DOWNLOAD GITHUB REPOSITORIES
1.  Open a terminal window.  As your username (NOT root), create the directory "develop" within 
/home/(username) .  This new directory is /home/(username)/develop .
2.  cd your way into this directory and enter "git clone (GIT URL)".  The GIT URL is the URL of 
the repository you need to download and can be found on GitHub.  For example, you can find the URL 
of the 9-test-github repository on GitHub by going to https://github.com/swiftlinux , 
selecting the 9-test-github repository (which takes you to 
https://github.com/swiftlinux/9-test-github), clicking on the SSH button, and looking at the URL 
just to the right of the "Git Read-Only" button.  In this case, the URL is 
git@github.com:swiftlinux/9-test-github.git .  Thus the command to download the 9-test-github 
repositories are:
mkdir ~/develop
cd ~/develop
git clone git@github.com:swiftlinux/9-test-github.git
3.  If you do not have a /home/(username)/develop/9-test-github, then you don't have Git set up 
properly.
4.  If the 9-test-github repository did properly download, shut down the guest OS and take a
snapshot.

DOWNLOADING ADDITIONAL GITHUB REPOSITORIES
1.  As a user (NOT root), enter "cd ~/develop".
2.  Enter "git clone (GIT URL)".  The GIT URL is the URL of the repository you need to download 
and can be found on GitHub.  For example, you can find the URL of this repository on GitHub by 
going to https://github.com/swiftlix , selecting the 0-intro repository (which takes you to 
https://github.com/swiftlinux/0-intro), clicking on the SSH button, and looking at the URL 
just to the right of the "Git Read-Only" button.  In this case, the URL is 
git@github.com:swiftlinux/0-intro.git .  Thus the command to download the 0-intro repository is 
"git clone git@github.com:swiftlinux/0-intro.git".
3.  Repeat step 2 for all additional repositories you need to download.
4.  Please note that the 1-build repository contains a script for downloading multiple 
repositories.
